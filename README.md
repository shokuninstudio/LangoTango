## Installation

Download the builds for macOS and Windows or if you want to build your own for macOS, Windows or Linux you'll need:

1. PySide6

pip install PySide6

2. Spellchecker

pip install pyspellchecker

3. Ollama or LM Studio

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)


Then git clone or download this repo:

```
git https://github.com/shokuninstudio/LangoTango.git
cd langotango
python langotango.py
```

If you are going to build it with Pyinstaller - langotango.ico, langotango_windows.py and langotango_windows.spec are for Windows (in the Windows folder).

## Hardware Requirements

The recommended language model is Gemma 3.

Fetch it from here:

12B version for GPUs with 16GB VRAM

ollama run gemma3:12b-it-qat

27B version for GPUs with more than 16GB VRAM

ollama run gemma3:27b-it-qat

## Important

LangoTango is hyper efficient and multi-threaded, but don't load multiple models at the same time unless you have a lot of VRAM!

Note, using language models to rewrite sections of text can cause loss of formatting because language models will generally only output left aligned plain text. 

## Issues

As LangoTango is a fork of Dillon, the word count tool won't work with writing systems such as Hanzi or Kanji which do not use spaces between words.

## Roadmap ahead

1. Notarisation / app signing.
2. Modular code. It's currently monolithic.
3. Manual.
